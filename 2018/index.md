    <p>Salon des Refusés ("exhibition of rejects") was an 1863 exhibition of artworks rejected from
    the official Paris Salon. It displayed works by later famous modernists such as Édouard Manet,
    whose paintings were rejected by the conservative jury of the Paris Salon. We feel that a similar space 
    is needed to explore new ideas and new ways of doing programming research and computer science.</p>

    <p>Many interesting ideas about programming struggle to find space in the modern programming 
    language research community, often because they are difficult to evaluate using proofs, 
    measurements or controlled user studies. As a result, new ideas are often seen as "unscientific".</p>
    
  </div><div class="col-md-6">
    <p>To provide space for unorthodox thought provoking ideas, we take inspiration from literary
    criticism. Papers that provoked an interesting discussion or criticism among the program committee 
    members were presented together with an attributed critical review that presents an alternative
    position, develops additional context or summarizes discussion about the work.</p>

    <p>In 2017, we accepted the 8 most inspiring papers out of 16 submissions. Below, you'll
    find the revised versions of the papers with critical commentary. We hope both will
    encou&shy;rage you to find new ways of doing and thinking about computer science!</p>

## Topics of interest
The scope of the workshop is determined more by the format of submissions than by the specific 
area of programming language or computer science research that we are interested in. We welcome 
submissions in a format that makes it possible to think about programming in a new way, 
including the following.

### Thought experiments
We believe that thought experiments, analogies and illustrative 
metaphors can provide novel insights and inspire fruitful programming language ideas.

### Paradigms
All scientific work is rooted in a scientific paradigm that frame what 
questions can be asked. We encourage submissions that reflect on existing paradigms or 
explore alternative scientific paradigms.

### From jokes to science fiction
A story or an artistic performance may explore ideas and 
spark conversations that provide crucial inspiration for development of new computer science thinking.

### Experimentation
We find prejudices in favour of theory, as far back as there is 
institutionalized science, but programming can often be seen more as experimentation than 
as theorizing. We welcome interesting experiments even if there is yet no overarching theory 
that explains why they happened.


### Metaphors, myths and analogies
Any description of formal, mathematical, quantitative or 
even poetical nature still represents just an analogy. We believe that fruitful ideas can be 
learned from less common forms of analogies as well as from the predominant, formal and 
mathematical ones.

## Format and dates
We welcome short papers (up to 3000 words) and long papers (up to 9000 words) as well as 
screencasts or interactive essays. We intend to publish accepted paper on the web, but any 
format is welcome for the submission. We intend to consider publishing post-proceedings using 
the [ACM SIGPLAN format](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) 
(`acmart` format with the `sigconf` option), so you can use this template for your submission too.

### Program committee
 
The program committee for the workshop will be announced soon, so please check back for more 
information! We will also soon share papers and critiques from the previous edition of the 
workshop, which should provide useful background (in no way exhaustive) for what format works well.
